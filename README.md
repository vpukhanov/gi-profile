# GI Profile

## Important

This app is no longer supported which is why I've decided to open source it. To add new characters and namecards, add new images to the asset catalogue, then edit the following files:

- [Shared/Data/characters.json](Shared/Data/characters.json)
- [Shared/Data/namecards.json](Shared/Data/namecards.json)

Build the app and the new items will be available to select in the UI.

## Abstract

GI Profile lets you create customised widgets with your favourite characters and name cards. The widget can display one of the playable characters' avatar, custom nickname and optional signature, as well as one of the name card backgrounds from the game itself. You can have as many different widgets as you'd like.
